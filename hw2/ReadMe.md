My class diagram is slightly different from the actual implementation when it comes to the panel decorators. My version of Visual Paradigm is broken, and after contacting Visual Paradigm support, I have still been unable to make it work again.
The main change is that there are now two different decorator types: Graph decorators and Text decorators. The Graph decorator has two classes which implement it: 
1. A bar graph which shows the volume for an individual stock
2. A line graph which shows the price for an individual stock
